## Above folders contain assigment in two parts along with the instructions to run.
### API Folder
> First folder only contain APIs as mentioned in the assigment, along with the postman collection and readme instructions. You can hit all the endpoints in the request and check them. This is the basic and raw implementation of the APIs as requested.

### Full-stack Folder
> Second folder contain the full-stack version of the app required along with the instructions to run. As it mentioned to design UI and consume APIs. So, I bootstrapped the UI and since UI have some specfic components and methods of rendering so, I have made some changes to the APIs accordingly like when rendering the cart component if it's in UI it takes the input and store it in localStorage so I need to modify the usecase and function accordingly and perform some of the functions inside react component as the input and props are given their.
>So, here I have made some changes to APIs for better clarity and compatibility. Although the idea and end goal is same as required.

### Check both parts accordingly
>Clone this repo and Go into any folder and hit npm start according to instructions.
>So, you can easily check accordingly if you just want the APIs to check first you can run the only API folder part and then you want to see
the full stack app functionality you can go and run the second folder.
>Thank you!
